# gifraw
GIF file raw reading library.

# Made for Animated GIF resizing
Because lack of PILLOW/imageio resizing gif, wrote this code.
See test_gifraw.py for demo.

# The key point is...
getting transparent color index and its colors. the gifraw module is for it.

# And, Generator
Frankly speeking, without generator gif file handling is more easier. but, for someone this approching will be an interesting issue.

# Don't forget
This is for demo. hope helping you.
